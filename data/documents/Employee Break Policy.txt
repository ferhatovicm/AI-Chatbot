Our employee break policy describes how employees should take breaks during their workday. We want our employees to be able to rest, eat and relax for some time during their workday to foster a pleasant workplace.

Our employees can take the following breaks at work:

 

Meal breaks

We provide all employees who work full time (40 hours a week, 8 working hours per day) with a 60-minute meal break. They should take it between 12:00 pm and 14:00 pm.

 

Rest breaks

Our employees can take additional 5-minute breaks for the rest 3 times during the workday.



How working hours are affected

The breaks are not counted as working hours.

 

Unforeseen breaks

We want our employees to feel well and be productive while working. If you become indisposed or experience another issue, or if you need a break longer than 5 minutes during the day ask your manager for an impromptu break.

 

Religious practices

Cape Ann accommodates employeesâ€™ religious beliefs and practices in a way they are allowed to take a break 2-3 times a day for prayer but are required to make up for that time by extending their stay at work or reducing time spent on a daily meal break.
